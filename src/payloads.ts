/**
 * Canonical emit-payload shapes for framework data patterns.
 *
 * The patterns (DataGrid, DataList, Timeline, CardGrid, List, Form,
 * InfiniteScrollSentinel, SortableList, ...) dispatch events via
 * `eventBus.emit` with these payload shapes. Typing them once here means
 * every emit site and every listener agrees on the contract — no more
 * inline `{ row: itemData }` literals that erase the entity type, and
 * no more `itemData: Record<string, unknown>` at the receiver.
 *
 * Pattern-specific payload contracts live here (in `@almadar/patterns`)
 * because they're pattern-level contracts — the framework-level generic
 * primitives (`EventPayloadValue`, `FieldValue`) stay in `@almadar/core`.
 * Patterns import the primitives and build named payload shapes on top
 * of them.
 *
 * Consumers:
 * - Component authors import the relevant payload type at the emit site
 *   and use `satisfies` to assert conformance without widening.
 * - Generated trait reducers receive the payload typed as one of these
 *   shapes, so a SAVE transition handler for a Form sees
 *   `FormSubmitPayload<T>`, not `unknown`.
 * - Verifiers can eventually assert "trait event X's declared payload
 *   matches the pattern's emit shape" once the patterns registry carries
 *   a per-prop `payloadShape` reference (follow-up — not in 2.17.0).
